              `Bind9Cluster` - Namespace-scoped DNS cluster for tenant-managed infrastructure.

              A namespace-scoped cluster allows development teams to run their own isolated BIND9
              DNS infrastructure within their namespace. Each team can manage their own cluster
              independently, with RBAC controlling who can create and manage resources.

              For platform-managed, cluster-wide DNS infrastructure, use `Bind9GlobalCluster` instead.

              # Use Cases

              - Development teams need isolated DNS infrastructure for testing
              - Multi-tenant environments where each team manages their own DNS
              - Namespaced DNS services that don't need cluster-wide visibility

              # Example

                      from this server. Zone transfers are used for replication between primary and
                      secondary DNS servers.

                      Default: Auto-detected cluster Pod CIDRs (e.g., `["10.42.0.0/16"]`)

                      Examples:
                      - `["10.42.0.0/16"]` - Allow transfers from specific Pod network
                      - `["10.0.0.0/8"]` - Allow transfers from entire private network
                      - `[]` - Deny all zone transfers (empty list means "none")
                      - `["any"]` - Allow transfers from any IP (not recommended for production)

                      Can be overridden at cluster level via `spec.primary.allowTransfer` or
                      `spec.secondary.allowTransfer` for role-specific ACLs.

                                Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                   tracking are needed,
                                c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                   a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                   information on the connection between this volume type
                                   and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.

                                Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information.

                                A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time.

The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                    An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                            DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                              allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                            * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                              preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                              specified.
                                            * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                              in any namespaces.

If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource exists. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-attributes-classes/ (Alpha) Using this field requires the VolumeAttributesClass feature gate to be enabled.'

                      When enabled (`true`), the DNS server will recursively resolve queries by
                      contacting other authoritative nameservers. When disabled (`false`), the
                      server only answers for zones it is authoritative for.

                      Default: `false` (authoritative-only mode)

                      **Important**: Recursive resolvers should not be publicly accessible due to
                      security risks (DNS amplification attacks, cache poisoning).

(Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.

If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type). This field cannot be updated once set.

This field is usually assigned automatically based on cluster configuration and the ipFamilyPolicy field. If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail. This field is conditionally mutable: it allows for adding or removing a secondary IP family, but it does not allow changing the primary IP family of the Service. Valid values are "IPv4" and "IPv6".  This field only applies to Services of types ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, and does apply to "headless" services. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to type ExternalName.

If not set, the default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.

                    Reference to a Kubernetes Secret containing RNDC/TSIG credentials.

                    This allows you to use an existing external Secret for RNDC authentication instead
                    of having the operator auto-generate one. The Secret is mounted as a directory at
                    `/etc/bind/keys/` in the BIND9 container, and BIND9 uses the `rndc.key` file.

                    # External (User-Managed) Secrets

                    For external secrets, you ONLY need to provide the `rndc.key` field containing
                    the complete BIND9 key file content. The other fields (`key-name`, `algorithm`,
                    `secret`) are optional metadata used by operator-generated secrets.

                    ## Minimal External Secret Example

                    ```yaml
                    apiVersion: v1
                    kind: Secret
                    metadata:
                      name: my-rndc-key
                      namespace: dns-system
                    type: Opaque
                    stringData:
                      rndc.key: |
                        key "bindy-operator" {
                            algorithm hmac-sha256;
                            secret "base64EncodedSecretKeyMaterial==";
                        };
                    ```

                    # Auto-Generated (Operator-Managed) Secrets

                    When the operator auto-generates a Secret (no `rndcSecretRef` specified), it
                    creates a Secret with all 4 fields for internal metadata tracking:

                    ```yaml
                    apiVersion: v1
                    kind: Secret
                    metadata:
                      name: bind9-instance-rndc
                      namespace: dns-system
                    type: Opaque
                    stringData:
                      key-name: "bindy-operator"     # Operator metadata
                      algorithm: "hmac-sha256"       # Operator metadata
                      secret: "randomBase64Key=="    # Operator metadata
                      rndc.key: |                    # Used by BIND9
                        key "bindy-operator" {
                            algorithm hmac-sha256;
                            secret "randomBase64Key==";
                        };
                    ```

                    # Using with `Bind9Instance`

                    ```yaml
                    apiVersion: bindy.firestoned.io/v1alpha1
                    kind: Bind9Instance
                    metadata:
                      name: production-dns-primary-0
                    spec:
                      clusterRef: production-dns
                      role: primary
                      rndcSecretRef:
                        name: my-rndc-key
                        algorithm: hmac-sha256
                    ```

                    # How It Works

                    When the Secret is mounted at `/etc/bind/keys/`, Kubernetes creates individual
                    files for each Secret key:
                    - `/etc/bind/keys/rndc.key` (the BIND9 key file) ← **This is what BIND9 uses**
                    - `/etc/bind/keys/key-name` (optional metadata for operator-generated secrets)
                    - `/etc/bind/keys/algorithm` (optional metadata for operator-generated secrets)
                    - `/etc/bind/keys/secret` (optional metadata for operator-generated secrets)

                    The `rndc.conf` file includes `/etc/bind/keys/rndc.key`, so BIND9 only needs
                    that one file to exist

                      including both Service spec fields and metadata annotations.

                      Annotations are commonly used for:
                      - `MetalLB` address pool selection
                      - Cloud provider load balancer configuration
                      - External DNS integration
                      - Linkerd service mesh annotations

                      Allows different service configurations for primary vs secondary instances.
                      Example: Primaries use `LoadBalancer` with specific annotations, secondaries use `ClusterIP`

                      See `PrimaryConfig.service` for detailed field documentation.

If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.

If this field is specified manually, the requested family is available in the cluster, and ipFamilyPolicy allows it, it will be used; otherwise creation of the service will fail.

This field can only be set when the Service type is 'LoadBalancer'. If not set, the default load balancer implementation is used, today this is typically done through the cloud provider integration, but should apply for any default implementation. If set, it is assumed that a load balancer implementation is watching for Services with a matching class. Any default load balancer implementation (e.g. cloud providers) should ignore Services that set this field. This field can only be set when creating or updating a Service to type 'LoadBalancer'.

The Kubernetes controllers that generate Endpoints and EndpointSlice resources for Services interpret this to mean that all endpoints are considered "ready" even if the Pods themselves are not. Agents which consume only Kubernetes generated endpoints through the Endpoints or EndpointSlice resources can safely assume this behavior.

                        Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                           tracking are needed,
                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                           information on the connection between this volume type
                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod.

                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information.

                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time.

The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                    DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                      specified.
                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                      in any namespaces.
